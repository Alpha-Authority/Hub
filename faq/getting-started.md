# Getting Started

## Newcomers

Quick few things you should know when gaining access to our infrastructure. 

* Infrastructure: All assets in public use can be found on this site. This includes our guides, groups, games, social media, etc.
* Events: Authorized Individuals, Allies, Verified Veterans, and Group Members have access to all public events, except for those who have been convicted of crime or are Blacklisted.
* Discord: Group Members have Automatic Entry into our Communications Discord Server, once they've verified their account through Bloxlink / Scriptos.
* Discord: Players who aren't in Alpha Authority, are allowed to ask for the Guest, Ally, or Veteran role\(s\). Granted the last 2, your identity would be verified by our staff before given either of them.
* Social Media: Players are allowed to use our social media under our rules. Those who are blacklisted from Alpha Authority will be blocked by any and all accounts connected to the individual immediately. Includes Discord, Twitter, Instagram, Snap, Reddit, etc.
